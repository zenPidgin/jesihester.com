			<h3>Michael Baker International Redesign Mockup</h3>
			<div class="details">
				<p><strong>My Role:</strong> Creator/Designer</p>
				<p><strong>Year:</strong> 2016</p>
			</div>
			<p>I was asked to create a mockup for a new redesign project for Michael Baker International. They wanted a more mobile-friendly design, and to incorporate a modernized full-width approach.</p>
			<p>Initially, this was approved to move forward, but the timeline they wanted was not feasible, so the project was disgarded.</p>
			<p>Despite not coming to fruition, I am very proud of this design, and I do hope that the leadership will move forward with this redesign in the future.</p>

			<h3>PMC Redesign Mockup Website</h3>
			<div class="details">
				<p><strong>My Role:</strong> Designer, Front-End Developer</p>
				<p><strong>Year:</strong> 2014</p>
			</div>
			<p>Prior to Michael Baker purchasing PMC, I was engaged heavily in redesigning the company's website. My team and I worked diligently on this project for about 8 months before the company was acquired. Our work for this project was done in Kentico.</p>
			<p>I was involved in creating the design, building the initial html/scss mockup website, and heavily collaborating with my teammates on the interactive elements of the website. I was very proud of our accomplishment.</p>
			<p>The only version that remains of this is the mockup website, and I can't say how much longer it will be live.</p>

			<h3>Michael Baker Website: Conversion from WordPress to Kentico</h3>
			<div class="details">
				<p><strong>My Role:</strong> Designer, Front-End Developer</p>
				<p><strong>Year:</strong> 2015</p>
			</div>
			<p>Michael Baker purchased us in 2015, and almost immediately, we began the task of converting their website from WordPress to Kentico. My role was to identify where we could make design improvements and convert the unorganized WordPress theme into a leaner, performance-focused design.</p>
			<p>The WordPress website was bloated with about 40,000 lines of CSS. I was able to reduce it to about 2500 lines. It may have a bit more now, as we have made quite a few updates since the last time I counted, but I considered that an achievement.</p>

			<h3>Alameda Restaurant Guide: Online Version</h3>
			<div class="details">
				<p><strong>My Role:</strong> Front-End Developer</p>
				<p><strong>Year:</strong> 2015</p>
			</div>
			<p>This was a challenging project, built over Angular.JS. My role was to take the printed design of the approved Restaurant Guide, and implement it on-screen. One of the issues was repeating colors. In the printed version, no two sections of the same color ever touched. However, they were also not listed in alphabetical order, as they would be on the website. I had to do some color swapping here and there. I also needed to recreate the icons, and set up the parent-child relationships for the categories and sub-categories.</p>
			<p>I had a lot of fun with mixins in this project and have the .scss files available for review if needed.</p>

			</div>
			<p>I created this project for a small, family-run business which is operated by one of my (now) ex-coworkers. Her and her husband had started their own business and needed a way to attract new customers to their business. This site was developed in WordPress, using a free theme that I customized to match their branding and tastes.</p>

				<p><strong>Year:</strong> 2013</p>
			</div>
			<p>This was my very first design-to-finish website with PMC/Michael Baker. I started with the style tiles, and worked meticulously with our contact at the library until she was happy with the design. This site is built on WordPress, using Zurb Foundation framework. We initially also built an intranet, but the plugin was buggy and after the website was launched, they didn't actually use it. But, they were very impressed with my determination to make sure they were happy with the website, and Annica left me an amazing review:</p>
			<blockquote>"…We are very happy with our great looking, responsive website. We appreciate all your work and I in particular appreciate Jessica’s quick responses and good explanations (and patience) to all my questions." - Annica Glenn, Technology Librarian/Webmaster</blockquote>
			<p>I will always hold a special place in my heart for Lincolnwood!</p>

			<p>This project was less design work and more CMS and content work. We converted their old, outdated website to WordPress. They had been using Dreamweaver to manage and update the content. Now, they can manage the website much more efficiently, and have the content organized in a much easier-to-read fashion.</p>
